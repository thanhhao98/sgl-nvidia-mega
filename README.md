# SGLang-NVIDIA-Mega

## Introduction

**SGLang-NVIDIA-Mega** holds the NVIDIA megakernels of the [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) framework: for each model it covers, the code of its small-batch decode step and the kernels that only make sense inside such a step, which hand their outputs to each other through mailboxes and programmatic dependent launch instead of through per-op boundaries.

The package loads as an SGLang [general plugin](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docs/docs/hardware-platforms/plugin.mdx) (the `sglang.srt.plugins` entry point) and is turned on with SGLang's `--enable-nvidia-megakernel` server flag. The package registers each model's spec with SGLang's megakernels framework (`sglang.kernels.plugin_kernels.nvidia`, `sglang.srt.megakernels` before sgl-project/sglang#45389). With the flag, SGLang checks the setup at argument resolution, before the weights load. After the model runner has prepared a covered model (before the KV cache is sized), SGLang builds the megakernel and replaces that model instance's `forward`, which runs each covered step itself and leaves every other step to the model's own forward. Every rank then logs `NVIDIA megakernel: active (…)`. Without the flag, SGLang runs untouched.

> **Experimental:** the kernels, the models and setups they cover, and the switch may change.

## Features

### Supported Models

| Model | GPU | Tensor parallel | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash | GB300 (SM103) | 4 | DSpark target verify steps of 1 to 384 rows (batch 1 to 64 at 6 rows a request) |
| Kimi K3 (packed MXFP4) | GB300 (SM103) | 8 | One-token decode steps of 1–8, 16, 32 and 64 rows |
| MiniMax-M3.1-Flash | GB300 (SM103) | 4 | DSpark target verify steps of 8 to 128 rows (batch 1 to 16 at 8 rows a request) and one-token decode steps of 1 to 16 rows |

For DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, larger verify steps, prefill and extend run SGLang's
standard path. The DSpark draft step runs on the plugin's draft spec. For Kimi
K3, the plugin covers the 93-layer language model (24 MLA and 69 KDA layers) at
the listed widths; every other call runs the standard path. For
MiniMax-M3.1-Flash, prefill, extend, wider steps and the DSpark draft step run
SGLang's standard path.

The Kimi K3 adapter is experimental. On the pinned GB300/TP8 configuration
below, every listed CUDA-graph width and padding boundary passed dummy-weight
capture/replay, B1 and B16 passed stock-versus-plugin real-weight canaries, and a
specialized-route/captured-replay canary passed, and the GSM8K quality protocol
matched its frozen stock-path reference score. This is bounded functional and
quality evidence; it does not claim performance, unlisted configurations, production
readiness, or publication readiness.

### What a covered DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash step runs

The step is the plugin's own code over the weights SGLang loaded (`deepseek_v41/runtime`): the embedding and the Engram hashes, then per layer the mHC boundary (`boundary/`), the attention (`attention/`), the MoE (`moe/`) and Engram (`engram/`), then the head and the logits (`logits/`). Each package has a stock implementation that reproduces SGLang's decode step bit for bit, and puts this package's kernels in where the slot plan (`plan.py`) gives them a width:

| Slot | Rows | Kernel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wo_b` + attention all-reduce + mHC post + next norm (`hop_a`, `hop_a_batch2`) | 1–16 | `wo_b` GEMM whose epilogue stores its rows into a Lamport mailbox on every rank, and a Lamport consumer that reduces them and runs the mHC post, combine and RMSNorm |
| MoE all-reduce + mHC post + next norm (`hop_b`, `hop_b_wide`) | 1–48 | Hop B: the top-k finalize and the shared-expert add on a Lamport mailbox, whose consumer runs the mHC post, combine and RMSNorm; past 8 rows it writes the next input's MXFP8 scales per 8-row tile, so the next layer's `wqkv_a` runs on the low-latency GEMM. Hop A's widths use hop A's mailbox, the wider ones a second one |
| Routed experts (`moe`) | 1–48 | A route kernel and a pair of block-scaled tcgen05 GEMMs with 8-row tiles; an expert chosen by more than 8 rows takes several tiles |
| Router top-k (`gate`, `gate_wide`) | 1–48 | One CTA per row, bit for bit SGLang's fused gate (including the vision-token routing) |
| Shared expert gate_up (`shared_ll`) | 1–48 | FlashInfer's low-latency MXFP8 GEMM with 8-row tiles on the alternate stream from the layer's fork, after a one-pass MXFP8 quant into its row-tile layout (bit for bit the shared linear's own quant); SGLang's clamped SwiGLU and `down_proj` follow |
| Replicated embedding (`embed`) | 1–48 | SGLang's fused lookup on the whole table, all-gathered once at build; no all-reduce |
| Indexer top-k (`attn_indexer`) | 30–48 (batch 5–8) | The decode indexer's top-k in the plugin's forward, reading SGLang's paged indexer metadata and writing its selection into SGLang's buffer; the index query and head weights run on the layer's second stream, under the compressor. At 6–24 rows, chunked metadata or without paged metadata SGLang's indexer runs |
| Engram prefetch (`engram`) | 1–8 (batch 1) | Every Engram layer's lookup and WKV quarter on a side stream; their two all-reduces on the main stream (SGLang's TP group) |
| Attention and MoE all-reduce + mHC post + next norm (`two_shot`) | 49–384 | Two-shot exchange: each rank sends row t only to its owner rank (t mod 4), which sums the four partials in rank order and sends the row back; the MoE post also folds the top-k finalize and the shared-expert add, and quantizes the next input to MXFP8 where SGLang's fused post does |

With the megakernel on, the default 39 slots run: the ones above, the attention chain, hop B's triggers, and the DSpark draft step's 16 slots. `SGLANG_NVIDIA_MEGAKERNEL_SLOTS` (comma-separated) overrides that list for tests and bisecting; empty runs every step function's stock code. The opt-in slots run only when listed there: `target_lm_head` (the target's LM head on the low-M kernel at 1-8 rows), `lm_head_pinned_tactic` (both low-M LM heads on one fixed tactic per row count, untuned), `hop_b_quad_trigger` (hop B's finalize-publish launches its consumer right after its own wait, batch 1 only), `hop_b_cap16` and `draft_embed`.

### What a covered MiniMax-M3.1-Flash step runs

The step is the plugin's executor over SGLang's own modules and weights (`minimax_m31/runtime`): the push-plane
boundaries (`boundary/`), the attention (`attention/`), the MoE (`moe/`) and the logits (`logits/`). With every slot off
it reproduces SGLang's verify and decode steps bit for bit; the slots put a kernel in where the slot plan (`plan.py`)
gives them a width:

| Slot | Rows | Numerics | Kernel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moe_nofill` (default) | 1–128 | bitwise | The routed experts' per-token NVFP4 input quantized into buffers built once, without FlashInfer's two fill launches per MoE layer |
| `hop_mxfp8` (default) | 1–128 | bitwise | SGLang's push-plane all-reduce + residual + RMSNorm kernel at the attention input also writes the qkv\|index GEMM's MXFP8 input (its MXFP8 epilogue), replacing the quantize launch per layer |
| `hop_ffn` (opt-in, needs `moe_nofill`) | 1–128 | bitwise | The same kernel at the FFN input also writes the dense MLP's or shared expert's MXFP8 input and a MoE layer's per-token NVFP4 input |
| `qk_store` (opt-in) | 1–128 | bitwise | The q/k/index norm + RoPE with the FP8 q epilogue and the NVFP4 K / V / index-K page store in one kernel, launched by SGLang's KV pool |
| `attn_ll` (opt-in) | 1–8 | tolerance | The qkv\|index GEMM on FlashInfer's low-latency MXFP8 GEMM; with `hop_mxfp8` the boundary kernel lets it launch at its entry |

`SGLANG_NVIDIA_MEGAKERNEL_SLOTS` (comma-separated) overrides the default list; empty runs SGLang's step code
throughout. A slot that changes a reduction order (`attn_ll`) is judged by accuracy against the switch-off server, not
by per-step parity.

### Design

- **Built at load.** Buffers, kernels and tactics for every covered width are allocated and compiled when the model is loaded, before the KV cache is sized. Nothing is compiled or allocated inside a step.
- **Graph-safe coverage.** A step is covered by its forward mode and row count alone, so every rank decides the same and a captured graph replays the decision made at capture.
- **Fail-stop synchronization.** DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash waits on another GPU have
  a deadline below SGLang's watchdog. A rank that misses it faults at address
  0x0, so no token from a failed step is returned. Kimi K3 validates SGLang's
  finite build deadline and compiles it into all six reachable TP8 remote-wait
  paths; expiry likewise stores through address 0x0 and traps.
  MiniMax-M3.1-Flash adds no wait of its own: its cross-GPU waits are SGLang's
  push-plane all-reduce kernels.
- **No silent fallback.** With `--enable-nvidia-megakernel`, an unsupported setup stops the server at startup, before the weights load, listing every reason; a model the loaded weights do not fit stops every rank after the load.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- An SGLang with the megakernels framework (`sglang.kernels.plugin_kernels.nvidia`, or `sglang.srt.megakernels` before sgl-project/sglang#45389; `--enable-nvidia-megakernel`)
- SGLang's CUDA 13 image: FlashInfer (its low-latency block-scaled GEMM as in 0.7.0 to 0.7.2), CuTe DSL (`nvidia-cutlass-dsl`) and the CUDA Python bindings
- DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash: 4 x GB300
- MiniMax-M3.1-Flash: 4 x GB300, the `minimax_m3_nvfp4` checkpoint
  (`MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash`), SGLang with the MiniMax-M3.1-Flash model and its
  CUDA 13.4 image, the push-plane boundary kernel's MXFP8 and NVFP4 epilogues and,
  for `qk_store`, the fused q/k norm + RoPE + NVFP4 KV store;
  `--moe-runner-backend flashinfer_trtllm_routed` (EP 1) and decode CUDA graphs
- Kimi K3: 8 x GB300 (SM103), BF16, context length 8192, TP8 and DP1,
  FP8 E4M3 KV cache with page size 64, `trtllm_mla` for prefill and decode,
  `flashinfer_mxfp4` with default precision, and full decode CUDA graphs

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/sgl-nvidia-mega.git
cd sgl-nvidia-mega
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash:

```bash
SGLANG_SPEC_TP_SYNC=rng,-dspark-accept-sample \
SGLANG_ENABLE_DSV41_ENGRAM_HOST_TABLE=1 SGLANG_DSV41_ENGRAM_HOST_TABLE_LAYOUT=per_rank \
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --tp 4 \
  --ep-size 1 \
  --kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3 \
  --dsv4-attn-backend flashmla \
  --speculative-algorithm DSPARK \
  --speculative-dspark-block-size 5 \
  --enable-nvidia-megakernel
```

The three environment variables are required by the DeepSeek-V4.1 spec; without them the server stops at startup, naming each.

MiniMax-M3.1-Flash (DSpark draft from the checkpoint's `dspark/` folder):

```bash
SGLANG_RAGGED_VERIFY_MODE=static \
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash \
  --trust-remote-code \
  --tp 4 \
  --moe-runner-backend flashinfer_trtllm_routed \
  --speculative-algorithm DSPARK \
  --speculative-dspark-block-size 7 \
  --reasoning-parser minimax-m3 --tool-call-parser minimax-m3 \
  --enable-nvidia-megakernel
```

Kimi K3 GPU and end-to-end suites are not yet part of these commands. The
MiniMax-M3.1-Flash kernel tests (`test/kernels/test_minimax_m31_*.py`) and
end-to-end tests (`test/e2e/test_minimax_m31_*.py`) need 4 x GB300; the end-to-end
tests serve `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash` unless
`SGLANG_NVIDIA_MEGAKERNEL_E2E_MODEL_PATH` names another copy.
